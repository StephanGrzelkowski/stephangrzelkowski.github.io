This is the first eurorack module I ever designed. It's based on the Teensy 3.6 hardware, which is a small microcontroller widely used as a development board for eurorack modules and based on arduino C libraries. 

I've heavily leaned on a [design by otemrellik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq041TmgRFw) and modified his code to synthesize a clap and a kick drum and to allow for more control over the drum parameters. I learned a ton about the teensy platform, and had my first exploration into writing some C code for arduino, which was more straightforward than I had expected. 

I took over some of the schematics documented on his github pages and modified it a bunch to adjust for my needs. The winterbloom creators have some amazing documentation on [their website](https://blog.thea.codes/designing-big-honking-button/). I ran into the usual trouble of soldering up all the connections but it gave me a lot of experience soldering up

I put together a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nmwIbejsAw) to document my design and showcase the module. It's quite detailed though.
