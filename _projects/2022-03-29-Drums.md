This is the first eurorack module I ever designed. It's based on the Teensy 3.6 hardware, which is a small microcontroller widely used as a development board for eurorack modules and based on arduino C libraries. 

I've heavily leaned on a [design by otemrellik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq041TmgRFw) and modified his code to synthesize a clap and a kick drum and to allow for more control over the drum parameters. 

I took over some of the schematics documented on his github pages and modified it a bunch to adjust for my needs. The winterbloom creators have some amazing documentation on [their website](https://blog.thea.codes/designing-big-honking-button/).

I made a youtube video to document my design and showcase the module [over here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nmwIbejsAw).
