There's a bunch more eurorack modules. A lot of these are simple utility modules, that were easy designs, but there's also some more interesting ones. Come inside and have a look at some nice pictures and short summaries of each module. 

The rack that I built in summer with some mediocre woodcrafting skills, is slowly starting to fill up.

I should start this off by listing some references, 'cause these peeps are amazing. This friendly Synthfox has a [lovely website](https://sfcs.neocities.org/) that has tons of really intersting modules with schematics that often explain some fundamental analog circuitry. If you have a look there, you will find a lot of similarities with the modules, I built myself. The winterbloom creator also has some incredibly detailed [blog posts](https://blog.thea.codes/) on their designs. 

I'll start with the interesting ones, that have the most creative newities (with lots of stealing ideas from other designers). 

This one is probably my favorite that I have built so far. It encapsulates **my favorite thing about analog synthesis - touch** *(I remember touch...)*. Aptly named "Schaltzentrale", it's basically some faders that output a static voltage (based on fader position and which of the Faders) and manual gates (+5V) with multiple outs each. It lets you modulate and send signals to different receivers, which is just the best thing ever. I learned a lot about reference voltages and buffering.

More touching: **Manual switch / mute**. If this looks similar to the divkid mutes module that's surely just a coincidence. It's basically a passive version of that. The problem with that is, that if you send audio signals through this, it produces annoying pops when you mute. I've found a trick that gets around this. Just route the gates through this instead, which sounds much better with post effects anyway. So for my purposes that's plenty good.
