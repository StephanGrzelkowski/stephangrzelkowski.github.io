Talon voice lets you set up voice commands to keyboard shortcuts. Have a read here how I'm using this to record music and SFX without having to touch my keyboard (insert looknohands.gif here)

The setup for this is pretty simple. Head over to [Talon voice website](https://talonvoice.com/) and have a look at the documentation. Then you can start writing your own commands and hook them up to your own shortcuts. 

You just say the line and talon does the shortcut for you. You can use [my file](assets/other/reaper.talon) to have a look at some examples. You'll need to make sure that your reaper shortcuts match the commands in the talon file. 

Be careful when recording your voice as talon will try to parse what you're telling it to do. Luckily you can just turn it off/on by saying "talon sleep" and "talon wake". You will have to cut that out of your final recording of course (or just set up your own custom action and hook it up to a shortcut that does that - say for example stop recording and cut first and last bar off).
