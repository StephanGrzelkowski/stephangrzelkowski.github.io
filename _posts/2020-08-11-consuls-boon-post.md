I took a weekend to design a card game. It's a conceiled betting game for 2 players where each card has a special effect that can potentially influence the outcome of a round. Think along the lines of "Air, Land & Sea" or "You're bluffing" ("Koehandel" in Dutch or "Kuhhandel" in German). 

You can find a write-up over.
