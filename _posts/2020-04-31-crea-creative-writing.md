In February, I started the Creative Writing I class at the CREA course center. For the class, we learned how to build your ideas into a story and wrote multiple shorts. That course is now finished and I had a great time learning about the fundamentals of creative writing. Thanks to Erik Ratschke for showing us the ropes.
