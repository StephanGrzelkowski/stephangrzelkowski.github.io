Past weekend the remote conference by NeurotechX gave us a look into how neural signals from the player could be used in games in the future. During the two day event, speakers such as Mike Ambinder from Valve and Dimitri Mikhalchuk from Tesla Suits presented the most recent innovations in the field and possible future trends. 

The recordings of [Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvjzPUtD2WY&t) and [Day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odkUcf-q8s0&t) were put on YouTube and are free to watch by anyone. I cannot recommend it enough to anyone interested in the intersection between neuroscience and game development. I was especially enthralled by the QA sections of both days which developed into interesting discussion by the panelists on the ethics of this new type of sensitive data and the dangers of building addicting games. The conference was thought-provoking and I hope to hear more about this topic in the future. Also, check out the organizers website [NeuroTechX](https://neurotechx.com/)!
