Welcome to my website! 

I'm currently an Audio QA Lead at Creative Assembly, working on DLC for Warhammer 3. I've been at CA since 2020, starting as a general QA technician as my first job in the gaming industry and then moving into Audio QA after a year there, having been a Lead since Nov 2022. In my time there, I have worked on Warhammer 3 release and multiple DLC. 

I graduated with a Master in Neuroscience from the University of Amsterdam in January 2020 and I have followed additional courses from the Master Artificial Intelligence there. During my academic career, I have been part of [different research projects](/research) for which I have worked mostly in MATLAB and Python in the field of Data Analysis and Computational Modeling of behavioral imaging data of animal and human brains cognition. 

In my freetime, I play music. I have been practicing classic piano since a young age and recently I started to get into jazz as well. I always have some kind of other instrument on the side that I'm learning more or less succesfully. I've also really gotten into Modular Synthesizers and even designed and built a few modules myself. 

For more information take a look at my [CV](assets/other/CV_StephanGrzelkowski.pdf).
