Welcome to my website! I graduated with a Master of Science in Cognitive Neurobiology and Clinical Neurophysiology from the University of Amsterdam in January 2020 and I have followed additional courses from the Master Artificial Intelligence there. During my academic career, I have been part of different research projects for which I have worked in MATLAB and Python and presented my work through scientific reports, posters, and presentations. You can find more information about that [here](/research). 

I am also interested in making (and playing) video games. I have joined multiple game jams (short hackathons for creating games) for which I have made small [projects](/gamedev) in Unity and GameMaker. I also create my own pixelart for these games. I am particularly interested in creating interesting behavior and artificial intelligence in games and have also done online courses on these topics on [UnityLearn](https://unity.com/learn) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). 

In my freetime, I play music. I have been playing classic piano since I was 6 and recently I started to learn to play jazz as well. I also picked up the bass guitar to learn a new instrument during the pandemic.

For more information take a look at my [CV](assets/other/CV_StephanGrzelkowski.pdf). 

Below are some of the things I have been up to latetly.
