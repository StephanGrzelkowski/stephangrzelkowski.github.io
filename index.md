Hi, I graduated with a Master of Science in Neuroscience from the University of Amsterdam in January 2020 and I have followed additional courses from the Master Artificial Intelligence there. During my academic careers, I have been part of different research projects for which I have worked in MATLAB and Python and presented my work through scientific reports, posters and presentations. You can find more information about the research [here](/research). 

I am also interested in making (and playing) video games. I have joined multiple game jams (short hackathons for creating games) for which I have made small [projects](/gamedev) in Unity and GameMaker. I create my own [pixelart](/pixelart) for these games. I am particularly interested in creating interesting behavior/artificial intelligence in games and have also done online courses on these topics on [UnityLearn](https://unity.com/learn) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/). 

In my freetime I play music. I have been playing classic piano since I was 6 but recently I started to learn to play jazz as well. I also picked up the bass guitar to learn a new instrument. It goes slowly. 

Below are some of the things I have been up to latetly.
