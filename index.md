In one of my past lives, I studied **Neuroscience** at the University of Amsterdam and did a bunch of courses on **Artificial Intelligence** there as well. You can read up on my [research projects](/research) if you want. 

If I can find time from playing video games all day, I do music related stuff, including [building stuff for my modular synth](/projects).
