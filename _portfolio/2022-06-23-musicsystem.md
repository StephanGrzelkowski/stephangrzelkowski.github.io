I wanted to explore building a wwise music system to get as much musical variation out of small segments of music, while creating a varied experience for the player and not sacrifing a catchy melody. 

There's two tracks in the project. One is meant for a stealth like segment and the other more open ended exploration. All of the segments are written with the Vital synth VST and drums are done with a simple drum sampler and 808 style samples. I didn't spend much time on creating the segments as I wanted to focus on the wwise implementation side of things.  

In the youtube video below I got into detail of all the different things I've used to build this system. If you just want to [listen to the results use this link](https://youtu.be/u_IkYoL2vjg?t=793) for the timestamp.
