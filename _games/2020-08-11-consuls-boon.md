I took a weekend to design a card game. It's a conceiled betting game for 2 players where each card has a special effect that can potentially influence the outcome of a round. Think along the lines of "Air, Land & Sea" or "You're bluffing" ("Koehandel" in Dutch or "Kuhhandel" in German). 

You are slave owners in ancient Rome battling for the Consul's approval against your rival. Each round in the arena you have to strategically use your fighters to win the battle. You can employ your gladiators to be the front row fighters of the battle or employ them for a strategic benefit supporting their companions. You win the Consul's favor by winning fight, but the more interesting the fight the higher the consuls favor. 			
			
I wrote up the rules for the game over [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sJiZ7btWnKski5YlvTz3AM39rIdINFHYap7aYFX5b5Y/edit?usp=sharing)	in a spreadsheet. On the bottom, you can cycle through the different versions of the game as sheets. In between, there are a bunch of notes from playtesting and a changelog.

A friend of mine was so nice to aid me with playtesting and to give me a bunch of feedback, so thanks to Janne. The first playthrough was eye-opening for all the little rules interactions/clarifications that I didn't think of during the design process.
