This is my entry to the QuarantineJam. You control a bunch of small puffballs that you can command around the environment. 

This was my first game in Unity and it fulfilled its goal to familiarize myself with the Unity environment. I also wanted to get some flocking behavior into the game for the characters which also worked out reasonably well and I got some pixelart practice in. You can play an html version of the game on [itch.io](https://acidplanetgames.itch.io/zuzu).
