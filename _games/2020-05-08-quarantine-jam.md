This is my entry to the QuarantineJam. You control a bunch of small puffballs that you can command around the environment. 

This was my first game in Unity and it fulfilled its goal to familiarize myself with the Unity environment. I also wanted to get some flocking behavior into the game for the characters which also worked out reasonably well and I got some pixelart practice in. For future improvements, I would want to add some gameplay as that is largely non-existent. I had different ideas for this evolving around managing the number of creatures in your flock. Combat was one possibility, where attacking or using abilities costs you some of your followers. Another idea was having a puzzle system where giving up part of your flock was necessary to progress. Another problem was the flocking behavior when it wasn't controlled by the player as it moves to loose at times. You can play an html version of the game on [itch.io](https://acidplanetgames.itch.io/zuzu).
