I participated in the cyberpunk game jam with a friend. We created a small arcade game where you hack into sockets to electrocute Robots. 

This was my first game jam which was a great experience. It was a 7 day event. I was in charge of coding and the environment art. We used GameMaker Studio, a great tool to create 2D games with pixelart. You can download the game on [Itch.io](https://acidgrunt.itch.io/sparks)
